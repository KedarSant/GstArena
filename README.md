An android app made for 30 days Kotlin challenge!
This app was made for the 30 days kotlin challenge. 
It consists of 8 screens.
This app uses retrofit for networking, and room implemented SQL database for offline caching.
It uses firebase for google authentication so if you download this code and try to run it on your machine, it won't work as I have not added your debug key to my firebase console.
However a Release apk file will be added soon to this repository, so you can check it out!!
